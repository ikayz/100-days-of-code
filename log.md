<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: March 5, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've made changes to a database table, added some styles to a form using a box shadow effect and added a new update page for artists.

**Thoughts** I've recently started sharpening my PHP and MySQL coding, and it's a great feeling working on a project I'll call my own.
